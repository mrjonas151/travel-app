# Travel App ✈️

**Travel App** is a web application developed with Node.js and TypeScript that allows users to explore popular travel packages around the world. Discover amazing destinations search for your vacations according to your preferences!

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure your development environment is set up with Node.js installed. I recommend using VSCode as your IDE. In the VSCode terminal, type the following command:


```
git clone https://github.com/mrjonas151/travel-app
```

### 🔧 Installation

A series of step-by-step examples informing what you need to run to have a working development environment:

First, identify the 2 main folders in our application: "frontend" and "backend".
Navigate to the "frontend" folder and run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

After that, return to the "backend" folder and repeat the process:

```
npm install
```

Now you have all the necessary dependencies installed. Almost there!

### 🔥Firebase
Finally, since we use Firebase to manage user authentication in our application, you need to create a project in Firebase and retrieve your Key to access Firebase:
Note that our application includes 2 example files for how the .env file should be configured. Follow those examples to securely place your Firebase keys!
Additionally, you need to retrieve and download the Firebase admin SDK json from the Firebase website and place this file directly in the backend folder, naming it "ServiceAccountKey.json".

## ⚙️ Running the environment on your local browser

Now that you have configured your Firebase keys correctly and installed the packages, it's time to run the project on your local browser. First, navigate to the frontend folder and run the command:

```
npm run dev
```

Then, return and navigate to the backend folder and run:

```
npm run dev
```


You'll be able now to have the server running in the backend and be able to visit the link provided by the frontend to navigate through the application's interface!
